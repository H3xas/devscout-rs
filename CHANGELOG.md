# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-25

Both entries are fixes for defects the first benchmark round found in this tool and
recorded against itself (`docs/benchmarks/results/2026-08.md`, "Defects this run found
in its own method"). Both change observable output, hence the minor bump.

### Changed

- **`find`: every manifest-pool row now carries a line.** Rows were `path: purpose`,
  with no line, so a follow-up could not open the hit at a position and the row failed
  the benchmark's follow-up-reach rule. They are now `path:line: purpose`, where `line`
  is that file's own first declaration in the name index, falling back to line 1 for a
  file the index carries no declared symbol for at all. The declaration block above it
  is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **`refs --all` now lifts the inbound cap too, not just the outbound one.** `--all`
  lifted `OUTBOUND_CAP` only, so a `refs` answer truncated at `INBOUND_CAP = 30` had no
  flag that could recover it and silently returned fewer referring files than the graph
  held. `--all` now lifts both caps. Output without `--all` is unchanged.

## [0.1.0]

Initial public release: `map`, `find`, `refs`, `impact`, `init`, `stats`, `clear` over a
C# and TypeScript/JavaScript index.
